## Project overview

In this module, "Einführung in die Künstliche Intelligenz" (Introduction to Artificial Intelligence), I have explored various fundamental concepts and techniques in AI. The module covered topics such as neural networks, machine learning algorithms, and their applications. I implemented a feed-forward neural network to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset and created a perceptron model to understand the basics of neural networks.

## Technologies used

- **Python**: Programming language for implementing AI algorithms
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical computations
- **Matplotlib**: Library for plotting images and visualizing data
- **PyCharm**: Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for writing and debugging code
